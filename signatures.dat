hex_general_commands.csv:
 Name: "General command detections."
 Extended Description: "This signature file can detect simple commands such as eval, require, include, unserialize, etc, often found in executable script files. It may be useful as a means to detect unwanted, obfuscated executable code and scripting hidden inside files that could be malicious, but could otherwise appear innocent and harmless, if you happen to allow only very small, "non-binary" (i.e., plain-text) files to be uploaded, small image files for forum avatars, etc, and if your website only deals with low volumes of uploads. However, it should be noted that this particular signature file poses a **VERY** high false positive risk! If your phpMussel setup or your website's upload facility deals with more than low volumes of uploads, is expected to process "binary files", anything other than very small files, or is expected to process large images, videos, executable files, etc, then this particular signature file should, in most cases, be avoided."

 Extended Description: "Signatures in this signature file work directly with file content (i.e., with zero or limited pre-processing). Covers a wide range of formats. Has a relatively low to average false positive risk, but also contains a very large number of signatures that aren't filtered by context (e.g., the type of file being scanned, its size, its extension, its magic number, etc). Due to the large number of unfiltered signatures, performance could sometimes be significantly reduced when scanning large files. If your phpMussel setup or your website's upload facility regularly needs to process large files, and if your machine's processing capacity is limited (e.g., not much RAM available, single-thread or single-process setups, using shared hosting with specific memory caps, etc), then this particular signature file should, in most cases, be avoided. Otherwise, if your server's processing capacity is good, or if your phpMussel setup or your website's upload facility generally only needs to process small files, it would be recommended."

 Name: "phpMussel URL scanner signatures."
 Extended Description: "Whenever a file is scanned by phpMussel, phpMussel will attempt to detect any URLs contained inside the file, and then match those URLs, their domain part, and their query part against lists of URLs, domains, and queries known to be malicious or dangerous. Existence of such malicious or dangerous URLs, domains, or queries would likely in itself be undesirable for most people, but may also indicate that the file containing them could potentially be malicious or dangerous too (although not necessarily proving that the file is definitively malicious or dangerous beyond all doubt). The memory footprint and performance cost is relatively small, and it has a very low false positive risk. Generally recommended for most phpMussel setups."
