clamav.cedb:
 Name: "ClamAV complex extended signatures."
 Extended Description: >
  Contains signatures adapted from some of ClamAV's former, now deprecated archive metadata signatures, as well as
  signatures adapted from ClamAV's container database, to work with some of the extended metadata generated by phpMussel.
  Generally recommended for most phpMussel setups, and has a very low false positive risk (but also doesn't contain many
  signatures and probably won't catch too much).

 Extended Description: >
  Contains signatures based on extended metadata generated by phpMussel. Signatures in this signature file target a wide
  range of miscellaneous threats covering a wide range of formats and vectors, including Android malware, chameleon
  attacks, forkbombs, web-based ransomware, malicious browser extensions, equation malware, etc. Generally recommended for
  most phpMussel setups, and has a very low false positive risk.

clamav.db:
 Name: "ClamAV standard signatures."
 Extended Description: >
  Signatures in this signature file work directly with file content (i.e., with zero or limited pre-processing). Covers a
  wide range of formats. Has a relatively low to average false positive risk, but also contains a very large number of
  signatures that aren't filtered by context (e.g., the type of file being scanned, its size, its extension, its magic
  number, etc). Due to the large number of unfiltered signatures, performance could sometimes be significantly reduced
  when scanning large files. If your phpMussel setup or your website's upload facility regularly needs to process large
  files, and if your machine's processing capacity is limited (e.g., not much RAM available, single-thread or
  single-process setups, using shared hosting with specific memory caps, etc), then this particular signature file should,
  in most cases, be avoided. Otherwise, if your server's processing capacity is good, or if your phpMussel setup or your
  website's upload facility generally only needs to process small files, it would be recommended.

  Whenever a file is scanned by phpMussel, phpMussel will attempt to detect any URLs contained inside the file, and then

  undesirable for most people, but may also indicate that the file containing them could potentially be malicious or
  dangerous too (although not necessarily proving that the file is definitively malicious or dangerous beyond all doubt).
  The memory footprint and performance cost is relatively small, and it has a very low false positive risk. Generally

 Name: "ClamAV SWF signatures."
 Extended Description: >
  Signatures in this signature file work solely and specifically with SWF files (i.e., Shockwave/Flash files). If there's
  any possibility that your phpMussel setup could be used to scan SWF files, then you should, in most cases, use this
  signature file. If not though, it won't most likely won't be particularly useful for you and should be ignored.
