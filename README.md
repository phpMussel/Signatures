## **What is phpMussel?**

An ideal solution for shared hosting environments, where it's often not possible to utilise or install conventional anti-virus protection solutions, phpMussel is a PHP script designed to **detect trojans, viruses, malware and other threats** within files uploaded to your system wherever the script is hooked, based on the signatures of [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net/) and others. For information regarding *HOW TO INSTALL* {2A+2B} and *HOW TO USE* {3A+3B} phpMussel, please refer either to the [Wiki](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/wiki) or to documentation included within the "[_docs](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel/tree/master/_docs)" directory of [this repository](https://github.com/phpMussel/phpMussel).

## **What's this repository for?**

This repository, "__[signatures](https://github.com/phpMussel/Signatures)__", is intended as a distribution point for phpMussel signatures.
